# Frontend Mentor - officelite website solution

This is a solution to the [myteam website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://elaborate-dragon-0e7077.netlify.app/). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
Despite the challenge being labelled as a 'junior' challenge I found that the layout proved fairly challening to build and change for different devices. Making a background pattern on the wrapper of the site to give the illusion that there is an element that looks like a footer is something that I haven't done before.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See error states when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` and/or `Email Address` fields are empty
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly
- **Bonus**: See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- **Bonus**: See a custom-styled `select` form control in the sign-up form
